AP CS A lab:  Consumer Review

In this repository, you'll find all the files needed for developing and testing the AP CS A lab "Consumer Review"
For our digital portfolio assignment, you'll work on developing the following methods:
    
     totalSentiment() from activity 2
     
     starValue() from activity 2
     
     fakeReview() from activity 3
     
     fakeReviewStronger() from activity 4 (Note:  I, Hartman, have changed the name of this to distinguish it from the one in activity 3.  the lab manual simply calls it "fakeReview()" )
     
     Rubric
     70% for Activities 1-4
     30% for Activity 5
